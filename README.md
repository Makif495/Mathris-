# 🧮 Mathris

A **Tetris-inspired puzzle game** that combines **mathematics and reflexes**.  
Solve math questions to clear blocks — or stack them if you answer wrong!

---

## 🎯 Overview

In **Mathris**, blocks fall just like in classic **Tetris**, but there’s a twist:  
each round presents a **math question** on the screen with **four answer options**.

- ✅ **Correct Answer** → The falling block **disappears** instantly.  
- ❌ **Wrong Answer** → You must **place** the block on the board.  

After each action, a **new question** and a **new block** appear — testing both your **speed** and **accuracy**.

- Dynamic **Tetris-style block system**  
- Randomized **math question generation**  
- Interactive **multiple-choice answer system**
